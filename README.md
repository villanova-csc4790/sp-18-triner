Overview: 

The overall goal for this project is to create a website that allows users to catalogue the video games they've played in the past as well as games they plan on playing. This website should allow users to create a profile, add video games they've played, add video games they plan on playing, and to link in accounts for video game platforms such as Xbox, Playstation, and Steam.

The website should provide information on the video games as well. An aggregate score given by the userbase, console availability, rating, and fetching a price from Amazon are features to be implemented. There are APIs that allow for connection to game servers and game platform services.
